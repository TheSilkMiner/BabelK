# BabelK
BabelK is a Kotlin library to generate random strings based on a context-sensitive grammar.

The project uses Kotlin Scripts to define the grammar rules, and provides an API that allows for integration into
any application. For broad reach, the library has been written with Java 8 in mind, but it also supports Java 9 modules
and will make full use of the technology as needed.
